-- Create a View called "forestation" by joining all three tables - forest_area, land_area, and regions
-- in the workspace
-- Keep in mind that the column forest_area_sqkm in the forest_area table and the 
-- land_area_sqmi in the land_area table are in different units (square kilometers and square 
-- miles, respectively), so an adjustment will need to be made in the calculation you write (1 sq mi 
-- = 2.59 sq km)
-- Add a new column that provides the percent of the land area that is designated as forest.
-- Note: It's important to take all original columns; otherwise, functions referring to 'forestation' donâ€™t work
